# Playing Card Recognition with EfficientNet B0

This repository contains a Python notebook that utilizes a PyTorch implementation of the EfficientNet B0 model to determine what playing card is in an image. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to train the model using a dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be fetched from the following link on Kaggle:
[Cards Image Dataset (Classification)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification)

The dataset includes images of playing cards belonging to different classes, suitable for classification tasks.

## Usage

To use the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed (PyTorch, torchvision, etc.).
3. Open the Python notebook `CardClasiffyer.ipynb`.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the data, train the model, and perform inference on new images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Other dependencies as specified in the notebook
